# Hack-Cambridge-Optiver-Challenge-Team-24
AKA 'Fantastic Twenty-Four'
## Inspiration
The stock market is hugely important in today's world, and it follows that technology can be used to make effectively handle stocks. So learning about trading strategies and how to write trading algorithms would be very beneficial for us as it gives us an insight into Fintech and Finance which could help us in the future.
## What it does
Our algorithm answers the Optiver Challenge by bidding and asking on a dual listing, among many other public trades.
## How we built it
We used the documentation and manual Optiver provided to learn how to use the Optibook API and then implement it into our own algorithm using Python. We collaboratively wrote this code in the AWS Cloud9 IDE.
## Challenges we ran into
We ran straight into the Optiver challenge, but our team was entirely new to Fintech. We had little to no background knowledge in Finance. Half of our team had no prior experience with the Python language used for Optiver's Optibook API. Sometimes our script crashed, but this was fixed.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We managed to write an algorithm which has processed hundreds of thousands of trades, and as of writing we're ranked in the Top 20 for PnL.
## What we learned
We learned how to use Optiver's Optibook API to write our first stock trading algorithm. In doing so we also learned a lot of terminology used in stock trading and now have a better understanding of concepts in Finance, as well as trading strategies, in particular those used in a dual-listing. Working on this algorithm we developed an understanding on how important it is that our code is correct. A simple logical error could have a catastrophic effect as we could lose a great amount of money in the real world. 
## What's next for Fantastic Twenty-Four
We hope to expand our knowledge in stock trading algorithms and perhaps design an algorithm for a variable number of instruments rather than a dual-listing.
